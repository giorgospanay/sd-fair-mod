# Supplemental material for paper: "Fair-mod: Fair Modular Community Detection"
Supplemental material for paper "Fair-mod: Fair Modular Community Detection", to be published in the proceedings for Complex Networks and their Applications 2024. Publication available here: <>.

This repository contains the implementation of the Fair-mod modularity-based community detection algorithm, with a weighted balance-based fairness. The implementation is based on the source code for Louvain community detection found in the NetworkX library-- see source code here: (https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/community/louvain.html). 

(Note 1: mention how algorithm works in practice -- b/r nodes coded in networkx object)
(Note 2: mention script for data processing)
(Note 3: mention sfairsc, translated code, and cite)
